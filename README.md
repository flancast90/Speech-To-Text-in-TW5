**Update on Status:** Looking for an experienced TW dev to add as collaborator on this project, so they can lend their experience in TW syntax for plugins, while I add some base JavaScript.

### First-Things-First: Browser Support.
The in-progress Speech-to-text plugin for TW5 has been decided to use the [Web-Speech API](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/demos/speech.html). According to [Dev.Mozilla.Org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API), this API is limited in support as of right now to ONLY the Edge, Chrome, and Safari browsers.

<br />

An MarkDown rendition of the support chart is given below
