### Getting Started


The Speech-to-Text plugin for TW5 is near limitless in applications in TiddlyWiki. Just like Google Docs already supports, the plugin adds a button to the wiki sidebar so that you can speak into the Mic, and get a transcript of your conversation as a TiddlyWiki Tiddler!

**Starting the Plugin to Record**

To test it out, follow the install instructions above, or just test out a demo version at [speech-to-text.finnsoftware.net](https://speech-to-text.finnsoftware.net). Once loaded, you should see a Microphone button on the wiki sidebar. Click it, and when you see a "Recording Started", you know that it is listening. For any questions, refer to the image below:

<br />

**Stopping the Plugin from Recording**

To stop the plugin, you can click the Mic icon on the wiki sidebar again, or, since >= v1.0.4, you can say "Ok Wiki, stop talking". You will get a message that the "Recording Stopped", and the transcript will be added to a new Tiddler (see image).
